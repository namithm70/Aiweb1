VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX - URGENT

Vercel is using old commit f7b2a12 but needs latest commit with vercel.json fix.

SOLUTION:
1. Go to vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your aiweb1 project  
3. Go to Settings tab
4. Click "Git Repository" 
5. Click "Disconnect" to disconnect the repo
6. Click "Connect Git Repository"
7. Reconnect namithm70/Aiweb1
8. This will force Vercel to use latest commit
9. Deploy should work with vercel.json fix

Alternative:
- Delete the entire Vercel project
- Create new project
- Import namithm70/Aiweb1 fresh
- Set Root Directory to "frontend"
- Deploy

This will fix the TypeScript path resolution issue.
